# Deep Learning Style Transfer

This is a small project I created while participating in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree<br/>
The goal of the project was to use a pre-trained convolutional neural network to transfer style from one image to another based on the "[Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)" article.<br/>
In order to do so I used the VGG19 pre-trained model, with alpha of 1 and beta of 1e6<br/>
Code is written in python with PyTorch library on a Jupyter Notebook platform.
